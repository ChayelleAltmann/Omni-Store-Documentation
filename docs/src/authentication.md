# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
  --header 'token: 123'
```

> Make sure to replace `123` with your API key.

Omni Store Front uses API Token to allow access to the API.

Omni Store Front expects for the API Token to be included in all API requests that need authentication to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`header 'token: 123'`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>123</code> with your personal API key.
